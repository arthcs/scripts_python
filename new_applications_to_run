bfs
    A benchmark for a Breadth-First Search implementation on GPU. It reads a 
    near regular graph as input and produces the cost (distance from source) of 
    each node in the input graph. 
    input sets:
    1M  - one million nodes
    10M - ten million nodes
    NY  - an irregular graph derived from the map of New York. 
    SF  - a scale-free graph that's been converted to a near regular graph

histo
    The histogram application computes the two dimensional histogram of a two 
    dimensional input. The input has the property of being concentrated mostly 
    in the center of the histogram.

lmb
    Implementation of a Lid-Driven Cavity fluid dynamics simulation using the 
    Lattrice-Boltzmann Method.  The input file is a discretized representation 
    of immobile flow obstrutions in the simulated volume.

cutcp
    A benchmark for computing short-range electrostatic potentials induced by 
    point charges in a 3D volume.  The algorithm derives its efficiency from 
    spatially sorting the point charges and ignoring long-range interactions.  
    This benchmark is adapted from VMD, a molecular modeling application.
