Effective Physical Core Utilization: 54.2% (23.837 out of 44)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for
 | other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 36.9% (32.478 out of 88)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first
     | step and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in
     | some cases can improve processor throughput and overall performance of
     | multi-threaded applications.

Memory Bound: 19.0% of Pipeline Slots
    Cache Bound: 21.5% of Clockticks
     | A significant proportion of cycles are being spent on data fetches from
     | caches. Check Memory Access analysis to see if accesses to L2 or L3
     | caches are problematic and consider applying the same performance tuning
     | as you would for a cache-missing workload. This may include reducing the
     | data working set size, improving data access locality, blocking or
     | partitioning the working set to fit in the lower cache levels, or
     | exploiting hardware prefetchers. Consider using software prefetchers, but
     | note that they can interfere with normal loads, increase latency, and
     | increase pressure on the memory system. This metric includes coherence
     | penalties for shared data. Check Microarchitecture Exploration analysis
     | to see if contested accesses or data sharing are indicated as likely
     | issues.
