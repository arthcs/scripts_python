Effective Physical Core Utilization: 9.9% (4.371 out of 44)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for
 | other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 4.9% (4.338 out of 88)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first
     | step and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in
     | some cases can improve processor throughput and overall performance of
     | multi-threaded applications.
     |
Memory Bound: 46.4% of Pipeline Slots
 | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant fraction of
 | execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load and
 | stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric breakdown by memory
 | hierarchy, memory bandwidth information, correlation by memory objects.
 |
    Cache Bound: 15.5% of Clockticks
    DRAM Bound: 41.3% of Clockticks
     | The metric value is high. This indicates that a significant fraction of
     | cycles could be stalled on the main memory (DRAM) because of demand loads
     | or stores.
     |
     | The code is latency bound, which means that there are a significant
     | fraction of cycles during which the code could be stalled due to main
     | memory latency. Consider optimizing data layout or using software
     | prefetches through the compiler to improve cache reuse and to reduce the
     | data fetched from the main memory.
