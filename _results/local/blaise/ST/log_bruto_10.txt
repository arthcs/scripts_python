Memory per array = 7.6 MiB (= 0.0 GiB).
Total memory required = 22.9 MiB (= 0.0 GiB).
Each kernel will be executed 2000 times.
 The *best* time for each kernel (excluding the first iteration)

This system uses 8 bytes per array element.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Array size = 1000000 (elements), Offset = 0 (elements)
Memory per array = 7.6 MiB (= 0.0 GiB).
Total memory required = 22.9 MiB (= 0.0 GiB).
Each kernel will be executed 2000 times.
 The *best* time for each kernel (excluding the first iteration)
 will be used to compute the reported bandwidth.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Your clock granularity/precision appears to be 1 microseconds.
Each test below will take on the order of 4053 microseconds.
   (= 4053 clock ticks)
Increase the size of the arrays if this shows that
you are not getting at least 20 clock ticks per test.
-------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING -- The above is only a rough guideline.
For best results, please be sure you know the
precision of your system timer.
